# Final project Genius bark

In a world where the connection between owners and their pets is deeper than ever, there is a growing need for comprehensive training solutions. Many owners, both new and experienced, face challenges in raising their dogs and often seek professional guidance. However, there is a shortage of accessible and effective resources to support them.

Our project, BarkGenius, aims to solve this problem by developing a mobile application that provides comprehensive training services for dog owners. The application will serve as a bridge between dog owners and professional trainers, allowing for easy access to personalized guidance and training programs tailored to the owners' needs.

Moreover, the application will allow trainers to provide various services to the dog owners, including monitoring the dog's progress, issuing personalized recommendations, and setting training goals.

The application is being developed using cutting-edge technologies, such as Flutter for the client-side interface and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend server. 

In addition to the basic training functionalities, the application will include advanced features, such as building a detailed trainer profile and managing communication between owners and trainers in an efficient and user-friendly way.

BarkGenius aims to set a new standard for interaction between dog owners and trainers, providing a modern and streamlined experience for dog training.
